# Super-Resolution-using-Denoising-Autoencoder
A TensorFlow based implementation of **Image Super-Resolution** via **Denoising Autoencoder**

Images were added with Gaussian noise and were sent into a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder which denoises the image and reconstructs it to a higher resolution.
